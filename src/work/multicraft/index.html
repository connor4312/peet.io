			<h1>Multicraft</h1>
			<p>In early 2014, the Multicraft panel was used by hundreds of thousands of people and companies worldwide. But, it was beginning to age, and was in need of a redesign. A past client suggested that I apply for this opening, for a designer, at Multicraft. I did, and was accepted. I reworked and recreated the Multicraft frontend from its roots, integrating a modern Grunt-based workflow, based on a LESS-ified version of the Bootstrap framework.</p>
			<p>The interface changes, though present, were superficial. What Multicraft wanted to create, and what I delivered, was the ability for customers to very easily and rapidly create an entirely new interface design, without particular programming knowledge.</p>
