			<h1>FerrousMC &amp; Chunklet</h1>
			<p>I was the Director of Web Development at FerrousMC before its acquisition by a larger company. I developed Chunklet, its own control panel. It integrated with existing systems and brought incredible new functionality, the likes of which had not been seen before in the hosting world - at least not in one package. These included hourly billing, external backups systems, automatic FTP transfers, automatic subdomain setup, automated MySQL setup and management, resource monitoring, and &quot;modpack&quot; installation, to name a few features.</p>
			<p>Parts of the site include the main theme, WHMCS integration, Multicraft integration, the PHP Chunklet panel, and a Node.js server daemon.</p>
