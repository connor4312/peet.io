			<p>The NitroHosts network was re-branding and merging together into one company. They were looking for a superb, attractive, dark design. I don't make dark designs often, but I gave it a shot. It came out looking very good, and their new site has a remarkably low bounce rate of under 5% as a result of it. Full Multicraft and WHMCS integration, naturally.</p>
