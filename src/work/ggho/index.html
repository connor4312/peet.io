			<h1>The GGHO</h1>
			<p>The Global Game Host Organisation is a standards-regulating organization, similar to the Better Business Bureau, to monitor and protect customers in the game hosting world. You can read much more about it on its <a href="http://ggho.org/about">&quot;about&quot; page</a>. I developed the majority of the website and systems for the GGHO. Though messy by my current standards (I started the project long ago before I mastered many PHP design patterns) it works and serves its purpose effectively.</p>
