			<h1>CraftYourBackup</h1>
			<p>CraftYourBox was in need of a simple but effective backup solution for their client's servers, to integrate with their existing panels and billing system. I created such a panel, which allowed for automated backups, manual backups, restorations, and downloads of backups, sharing a user system with their Multicraft installation and a billing system with their WHMCS billing system. I developed the web panel, as well as the backup daemon.</p>
