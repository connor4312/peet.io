			<h1>SpaceGDN</h1>
			<p>Xereo had the intrepid goal of creating a full game control panel, SpaceCP. They're well on their way with a beta out next month, and I helped out a bit. I developed the SpaceGDN, a delivery API for game sources. This high-performance system was written in Python, and is freely available for all to use and contribute to.</p>
