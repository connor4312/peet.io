			<h1>The Chunk</h1>
			<p>The Chunk is a game community site, for which I created both the front-end and the backend. The backend, which was written in PHP with the Laravel framework, hooked into The Chunk's in-house Java plugins. The Chunk's website includes a full-feature forum profiles system, and, of course, statistics tracking and leaderboards.</p>
