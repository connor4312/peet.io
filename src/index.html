				<p>My name is Connor, as you probably guessed. I am a web designer, web developer, and (for a few more years) a student. In spite of that, in my seven-odd years of web development experience, Iâ€™ve had the chance to work at or for some of the most awesome people and companies on the net.</p>
	
				<p>I love to learn and explore new things, and as a result have become proficient in far more many languages and systems than I can list here. But, chances are, if it touches the web, I can build it.</p>

				<li>Having called upon Connor when I was desperate for a website design, without warning or sufficient time, he was able, regardless of all these constraints, to perform his duties <b>miraculously and without delay</b>. Not only was he able to complete the jobs that I needed done, but he also delivered a service that was <b>courteous, understanding and of an exceptional quality</b>. He took my vision of what I wanted my website to look like, and gave me back <b>something even better</b>. You would be hard pressed to find such value for money anywhere else on the internet, and it is clear to me that this designer has <b>exceptional talent and ability</b> to craft professional websites to suit your needs. <i>Kya S., Treehouse Software</i></li>
				<li>He is worth every penny, he is doing a great design with even better quality. I will for sure hire him again when I need a new design! <i>Mark T., Gamerstick</i></li>
				<li>I would highly recommend Connor for any internet site development where <b>creativity and artistic</b> talent is something you value. Time and time again Connor went <b>above and beyond</b> what I expected, Connor has some real amazing skills when it comes to design and PHP development and made difficult tasks look easy. In addition, he was very <b>easy to work with</b> and provided numerous design suggestions and cost saving measures that were very valuable to me. Finally, Connor completed the project in a time frame that was <b>unmatched</b> by the other freelancers. I would be happy to recommend Connor to anyone in need of a <b>creative genius</b>. <i>Jack R., HalfPriceLaw</i></li>
				<li>I ordered a overlay navigation bar from Connor and, was a bit cautious about paying people up front. I told him this, and he said pay me after you see it working. I agreed and he worked on my project. Once he was done I tested it out. Overall the whole process ran smoothly and I was very happy with the end result. Thanks again Connor! <i>HostAtom</i></li>
				<li>Connor is the goto-guy for getting your website made. Organised, efficient and effective. My development and collaboration website is all these things and more! <i>Jacob C., PixelPartake</i></li>
